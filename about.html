    We have tried our level best to make this music player. Not only it helps to refresh our mind and soul, but also this project have provided us the opportunity to
        improve our web development skills. No doubt there are many areas to improve but in 
        future we will try to make improvement in those areas. <br> <br>
    Also the credit for the art(images) and music goes to their rightful owners. We don't own 
or show any sort of ownership to the content we have used.
Our motto to develop this project was to improve our hands on practice and to make something constructive 
which can provide beautiful experience to our viewers. </p></h3>
